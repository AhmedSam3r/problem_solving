# (1) reverse LL
### Explanation of Fixes
- Recursive Call Should Return the New Head:
  - The base case ensures that the last node (new head) is returned.
  - Each recursive call should pass this new_head back to the previous caller.
- Reversing the Two Nodes Correctly:
  - head.next.next = head â†’ Makes the next node point back to head.
  - head.next = None â†’ Prevents cycles by disconnecting head from the next node.
- Returning the Correct New Head:
    - We must return new_head at the end of the function to maintain the correct reference.



### **1. Why does recursively `head.next.next = head` work?**
This line correctly reverses the linkage by pointing the next nodeâ€™s `next` back to the current node.  

#### **Step-by-step breakdown with an example:**
Consider the linked list:
**`1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None`**  
Let's go step by step through the recursion:

---

#### **Recursive Calls:**
1. **First call (`head = 1`)**
   - Calls `reverse_head(2)`

2. **Second call (`head = 2`)**
   - Calls `reverse_head(3)`

3. **Third call (`head = 3`)** (Base Case)
   - Since `head.next is None`, returns `head (3)`

---

#### **Unwinding the recursion:**
Now we return from the recursive calls step by step.

##### **Returning to Second Call (`head = 2`)**
- `prev = 3` (returned from `reverse_head(3)`)
- **Key step:**  
  ```python
  head.next.next = head  # 2.next (which is 3), so 3.next = 2 (reverse the link)
  ```
  - Now the link is **`3 -> 2`**
- `head.next = None  # 2.next = None` to remove the old forward link
- Returns `prev` (`3`)

##### **Returning to First Call (`head = 1`)**
- `prev = 3` (returned from `reverse_head(2)`)
- **Key step:**  
  ```python
  head.next.next = head  # 1.next (which is 2), so 2.next = 1 (reverse the link)
  ```
  - Now the link is **`2 -> 1`**, and combined with the previous step, we get **`3 -> 2 -> 1`**
- `head.next = None  # 1.next = None` to remove the old forward link
- Returns `prev` (`3`) as the new head

---

#### **Why does this work?**
- `head.next` is the **next node in the original list**.
- `head.next.next = head` makes the next node **point back to the current node**, reversing the link.
- `head.next = None` ensures no loops are formed.

# (2) merge sorted list
### **Explanation of Recursive Merge for Two Sorted Lists**
This function recursively merges two sorted linked lists (`list1` and `list2`) and returns a single sorted linked list.

---

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**
#### **Base Cases**
1. **If `list1` is `None`**, return `list2`:  
   - If `list1` is empty, there's nothing to merge, so return `list2` as the result.
   - `if list1 is None: return list2`

2. **If `list2` is `None`**, return `list1`:  
   - If `list2` is empty, just return `list1` as the merged list.
   - `if list2 is None: return list1`

#### **Recursive Merging**
If neither list is empty, compare their first elements:
- If `list1.val <= list2.val`:  
  - `list1` should be the next node in the merged list.
  - Recursively merge the rest: `list1.next = self.mergeTwoLists(list1.next, list2)`
  - Return `list1` as it is the smaller node.

- Otherwise (`list1.val > list2.val`):  
  - `list2` should be the next node in the merged list.
  - Recursively merge the rest: `list2.next = self.mergeTwoLists(list1, list2.next)`
  - Return `list2` as it is the smaller node.

---

### **Why Do We Use `list1.next = ...` and `list2.next = ...`?**
When we choose a node (`list1` or `list2`) as the next node in the merged list, we must **attach the remaining sorted list** to it.

- If `list1` is smaller, the next element in `list1` should point to the result of merging `list1.next` and `list2`.
- If `list2` is smaller, the next element in `list2` should point to the result of merging `list1` and `list2.next`.

This ensures that the linked list structure remains correct as the recursion unwinds.

---

### **Visualization of Recursion**
#### Example 1:
```python
list1 = [1 -> 3 -> 5]
list2 = [2 -> 4 -> 6]
```
1. Compare `1` and `2` â†’ `1` is smaller, so `1.next = mergeTwoLists(3 -> 5, 2 -> 4 -> 6)`
2. Compare `3` and `2` â†’ `2` is smaller, so `2.next = mergeTwoLists(3 -> 5, 4 -> 6)`
3. Compare `3` and `4` â†’ `3` is smaller, so `3.next = mergeTwoLists(5, 4 -> 6)`
4. Compare `5` and `4` â†’ `4` is smaller, so `4.next = mergeTwoLists(5, 6)`
5. Compare `5` and `6` â†’ `5` is smaller, so `5.next = mergeTwoLists(None, 6)`
6. `list1` is `None`, return `6`
7. The final merged list:  
   **`1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6`**

---

### **Time Complexity Analysis**
Since each node is visited once, and each recursive call processes one node, the time complexity is:
\[
O(m + n)
\]
where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two lists.

---

### **Final Thoughts**
This recursion works because it **builds the merged list from the smallest elements first**, correctly linking the nodes step by step as recursion unwinds.

# (3) cyclic Linked List
### **Solution Approaches**
To detect a cycle in a linked list, there are two common approaches:

#### **1. Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare Method)**
This approach uses two pointers:
- **Slow pointer (`slow`)** moves one step at a time.
- **Fast pointer (`fast`)** moves two steps at a time.
- If there is a cycle, `fast` will eventually meet `slow`. If `fast` reaches `None`, then there's no cycle.

âœ… **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)  
âœ… **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \)  

### **Would This Code Work?**
```python
if not head or not head.next:
    return False
prev_addr = id(head)
head = head.next
while head:
    curr_addr = id(head)
    print(f"cur_addr={curr_addr} vs prev={prev_addr}, prev_addr < curr_addr: {prev_addr < curr_addr}")
    if prev_addr < curr_addr:
        prev_addr = curr_addr
    else:
        print(f"@pos={head.val}")
        return True
    head = head.next

return False
```

### **Issues in the Given Code**
1. **`id(head)` does not guarantee increasing addresses**  
   - Python's `id()` gives the memory address of an object, but objects aren't necessarily allocated in increasing order.
   - Memory addresses **can** be reused, leading to **false positives**.
   - Example: If `id()` reuses an address from a deleted object, the condition `prev_addr < curr_addr` may fail incorrectly.

2. **Fails for loops at the start**
   - The approach assumes that addresses are always increasing. However, in a cycle, the same memory address **repeats**.

3. **Does not detect all cycle cases**  
   - If the cycle is in the middle or end, it may not be detected correctly.

### **Would it Work?**
ðŸš« **No, it will not reliably detect cycles in a linked list.**  
ðŸ”¹ It **may work in some cases**, but it is **not a valid cycle detection algorithm**.

### **Better Approach?**
Use **Floyd's cycle detection** or **a hash set** as shown above.

Would you like a deeper explanation of how memory addresses behave in Python? ðŸš€



# (4) reorder linked list
## 1. Iterative approach 
### **Updated Code with `head` Instead of `temp_head`**
```python
def reorderList(head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
    if not head or not head.next:
        return

    save = []
    curr = head

    # Step 1: Store all nodes in a list
    while curr:
        save.append(curr)
        curr = curr.next

    i, j = 0, len(save) - 1
    prev = ListNode(-1)  # Dummy node
    head = prev  # Rename temp_head to head

    # Step 2: Reorder the linked list
    while i <= j:
        head.next = save[i]  # Link the next node
        head = head.next  # Move head forward
        i += 1

        if i <= j:
            head.next = save[j]  # Link the next node from the end
            head = head.next  # Move head forward
            j -= 1

    head.next = None  # Avoid cycles

    return prev.next  # Start of the reordered list
```

---

### **Why `head.next` Works Correctly**
Let's break it down:

1. **`head = prev` ensures `prev.next` always points to the start of the new reordered list.**
   - `prev` is a dummy node (`ListNode(-1)`) that acts as a placeholder.
   - We iterate and keep linking nodes using `head.next = node`.

2. **`head.next = save[i]` links the `i-th` node to the reordered list.**
   - `head = head.next` moves `head` forward to this newly linked node.

3. **`head.next = save[j]` then links the `j-th` node (from the end).**
   - Again, `head = head.next` moves `head` forward to this newly linked node.

4. **`head.next = None` at the end prevents forming a cycle.**
   - Without this, the last node might still have a `next` pointer leading to an unwanted cycle.

### **Visualization Example**
Let's say we have:
```
Original List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
```
Step-by-step:
1. `save = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
2. Iterations:
   - Link `1` â†’ `5`
   - Link `2` â†’ `4`
   - Link `3` (middle node remains in place)
3. **Final List:**
   ```
   1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3
   ```

Since we **always use `head.next` to attach the next node** and move forward with `head = head.next`, the list is correctly reordered while `prev.next` remains the start of the new linked list.

ðŸš€ **This ensures that `prev.next` always holds the full reordered linked list!**


--

The second loop runs faster than the first one because of an unnecessary operation in the first loop. Letâ€™s analyze both loops in detail.

---

### **Difference Between Both Loops**
### **First Loop (Slower)**
```python
while head:
    next = head.next
    head.next = None  # Breaking the linked list connections
    save.append(head)
    head = next  # Move to the next node
```
- **Whatâ€™s happening?**
  - We **store** the current `head` node in `save`.
  - We **break** the link by setting `head.next = None`, which modifies the linked list.
  - We **move** to the next node manually using a temporary `next` variable.

### **Second Loop (Faster)**
```python
while head:
    save.append(head)  # Just store the node
    head = head.next  # Move to the next node
```
- **Whatâ€™s happening?**
  - We **store** the current `head` node in `save`.
  - We **move** to the next node **without modifying the linked list**.

---

## **Why Is the First Loop Slower?**
1. **Extra Write Operation (`head.next = None`)**
   - Every time we process a node, we modify its `next` pointer, which means an extra memory write operation.
   - This introduces unnecessary **cache invalidation** and **memory updates** that slow down execution.

2. **Extra Variable (`next = head.next`)**
   - The first loop explicitly stores `head.next` in `next`, which adds **an extra read operation**.
   - The second loop simply updates `head = head.next`, avoiding that extra step.

3. **Breaking the Linked List Adds Overhead**
   - Modifying the linked list (`head.next = None`) forces Python's garbage collector to **handle unlinked nodes** differently.
   - Even though all nodes are still referenced in `save`, Python's memory management might introduce slight delays due to handling those changes.

---

## **Conclusion**
- The second loop **avoids unnecessary memory writes** and **extra variable assignments**, making it more efficient.
- **Best practice:** When storing a linked list in an array, avoid modifying it unless necessary.

This small optimization **reduces runtime**, as seen in your submission. ðŸš€

---
## 2. Recursion approach
### Python recursion code
```python
class Sol:
    def reorderList_recurse(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        def recurse(tail, head):
            if not tail.next:
                print(f"RETURN HERE={tail}")
                return tail

            new_tail = recurse(tail.next, head)
            print(f"head={head}, tail={tail}", end=' ')
            next = head.next
            head.next = new_tail
            print(f", next={next}")
            head = head.next  # it doesn't take effect, each time head addr is going to be sent
            head = tail
            
            return head
        # prev = head = ListNode(-1)
        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        dummy.next = head
        res = recurse(head, head)
        print(f"--- FINAL ---, head={head}, res={res}, dummy={dummy.next}")
        return dummy.next
```


Your current recursive approach has a few issues that prevent it from correctly reordering the linked list. Letâ€™s analyze the problems and then provide a proper recursive solution.

---

## **Problems in Your Current Code**
### **1. `head = head.next` Does Not Persist**
- In Python, when you do `head = head.next`, it **only changes the local variable** inside the function.
- This does **not** affect the actual linked list structure because Python passes objects **by reference**, but reassigning `head` only updates the local reference, not the original list.

### **2. `recurse(tail.next, head)` Always Returns the Wrong `new_tail`**
- Your recursion only progresses `tail`, but `head` stays the same in each recursive call.
- This means `head` does **not** update as the list is reordered, leading to incorrect node placements.

### **3. Base Case Doesn't Handle Even/Odd Lengths Properly**
- Right now, you are only checking `if not tail.next:` which isn't enough to stop the recursion at the midpoint.
- You also need to stop when `head` **catches up** to `tail`.

---

## **Fixing the Recursive Approach**
### **Steps to Solve It Correctly**
1. **Use a helper function that takes both `head` and `tail`.**
2. **Stop recursion when `head` reaches `tail` or surpasses it.**
3. **Properly update `head` globally instead of locally.**
4. **Rearrange pointers without breaking the linked list structure.**

---

## **Fixed Recursive Solution**
```python
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        def recurse(tail):
            nonlocal head  # Allow `head` to be updated globally
            if not tail:  # Base case: end of list
                return None
            new_tail = recurse(tail.next)  # Recurse until the end
            
            if head is None or head == new_tail or head.next == new_tail:
                return None  # Stop when head meets tail
            
            next_head = head.next  # Store next head before modifying
            head.next = new_tail  # Reorder: head -> tail
            new_tail.next = next_head  # tail -> next_head
            
            head = next_head  # Move head forward
            
            return next_head  # Return next node for reference
        
        recurse(head)  # Start recursion
```

---

## **Explanation**
1. **Base Case:**  
   - The recursion stops when `tail` is `None` (end of the list).
   - It also stops when `head` catches up to `tail`, ensuring we donâ€™t loop indefinitely.

2. **Recursive Call:**  
   - We call `recurse(tail.next)` until we reach the end.
   - This ensures we start processing from the **last node** back to the front.

3. **Reordering Logic:**
   - We reorder `head.next = new_tail` (point `head` to `tail`).
   - Then, we set `new_tail.next = next_head` (point `tail` to the next node in sequence).
   - Finally, we move `head` forward.

4. **Ensuring the Correct Stopping Condition:**  
   - If `head == new_tail` (odd-length list), stop.
   - If `head.next == new_tail` (even-length list), set `new_tail.next = None` to prevent cycles.

---

## **Time Complexity Analysis**
- The function processes each node **once** in `O(n)`, making it efficient.
- The recursion depth is **at most `O(n)`**, which is acceptable for linked lists of reasonable size.

This should work as expected! ðŸš€


--------

## Wrong fast and slow writing
this code cause infinite loop and pointers not correctly moved forward.

even if we added dummy pointer and moved it like `dummy=dummy.next`
```python
   slow = fast = head
   while fast and fast.next:
      slow = head.next
      fast = head.next.next
```
the correct way is to move each pointer forward `slow=slow.next` and `fast=fast.next`
```python
   slow = fast = head
   while fast and fast.next:
      slow = slow.next
      fast = fast.next.next
```


# (5) remove nth element
### **1. Understanding the One-Pass Two-Pointer Approach**
To understand why the **two-pointer (fast and slow)** approach always works, let's break it down logically.

#### **Thinking Process Behind the Approach**
- The key observation is that the **nth node from the end** is the **(length - n + 1)th** node from the beginning.
- Instead of calculating the length, we use two pointers:
  1. Move `fast` pointer **n steps ahead**.
  2. Move both `slow` and `fast` pointers **together** until `fast` reaches the end.
  3. Now, `slow` is positioned just **before** the node to be deleted.
  4. Remove the node by adjusting `slow.next`.

#### **Why Does This Work for All Cases?**
- **Case 1: Deleting the last node**  
  - If `n = 1`, `fast` moves one step ahead, then `slow` stops just before the last node.
- **Case 2: Deleting the first node**  
  - If `n = length of list`, `fast` moves to `None` after `n+1` steps, and `slow` stays at `dummy`, which allows us to update `head`.
- **Case 3: Deleting a middle node**  
  - The two-pointer method ensures `slow` stops exactly before the node to be removed.

#### **Mathematical Proof**
1. The `fast` pointer moves `n+1` steps ahead.
2. The `slow` pointer starts from `dummy` and moves **at the same pace** as `fast`.
3. When `fast` reaches `None`, `slow` is **exactly at (length - n)th node**, which is **before** the node to be removed.
4. We correctly update `slow.next`, removing the desired node.

Thus, this approach **always works** for any valid `n` within the constraints.

---

### **2. Explaining the Recursive Approach**
#### **Recursive Code**
```python
    def remove_recursion(self, head: ListNode, n: list):
        if not head:
            return None

        head.next = self.remove_recursion(head.next, n)
        n[0] -= 1
        if n[0] == 0:
            return head.next
        return head

    def removeNthFromEnd_recursion(self, head, n):
        """
        We pass it as a list to pass the element by reference
        """
        return self.remove_recursion(head, [n])

    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        return self.removeNthFromEnd_recursion(head, n)
```

---

### **Step-by-Step Execution**
Let's take the example:

```plaintext
head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
```

**Recursive Calls Breakdown:**
- Each call goes deeper into the list until `head` becomes `None` (base case).
- As recursion unwinds, `n[0]` is decremented and once it reaches `0`, we skip that node.

| Call Stack | `n[0]` | ListNode Processed | Action Taken |
|------------|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| `remove_recursion(1)` | 2 | Head = `1` | Calls next |
| `remove_recursion(2)` | 2 | Head = `2` | Calls next |
| `remove_recursion(3)` | 2 | Head = `3` | Calls next |
| `remove_recursion(4)` | 2 | Head = `4` | Calls next |
| `remove_recursion(5)` | 2 | Head = `5` | Calls next |
| `remove_recursion(None)` | 2 | Base Case | Returns None |
| Returning `remove_recursion(5)` | 1 | `5` is returned | `n[0] -= 1` |
| Returning `remove_recursion(4)` | 0 | `4` is skipped | Returns `5` |
| Returning `remove_recursion(3)` | -1 | Returns `3 -> 5` |
| Returning `remove_recursion(2)` | -1 | Returns `2 -> 3 -> 5` |
| Returning `remove_recursion(1)` | -1 | Returns `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5` |

#### **Final Output:**  
```plaintext
[1,2,3,5]
```

---

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Recursive Approach**
   - Recursion goes deep into the list until `head == None`.
   - As it **unwinds**, we decrement `n[0]`.
   - When `n[0] == 0`, we **skip** that node by returning `head.next`.

2. **Why Pass `n` as a List?**
   - We need `n` to be **mutable** so that it updates across recursive calls.
   - Python integers are **immutable**, so passing `n` directly wouldnâ€™t work.

---

### **Comparing Approaches**
| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Best Use Case |
|----------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Two-Pass (Length Calculation)** | \(O(n)\) | \(O(1)\) | Simple cases |
| **One-Pass (Two Pointers)** | \(O(n)\) | \(O(1)\) | Most optimal approach |
| **Recursive Approach** | \(O(n)\) | \(O(n)\) (stack) | When recursion is preferred |

ðŸš€ **Recommendation:** Use the **one-pass two-pointer approach** for efficiency.


# (6) copy list random
## Why this doesn't work
### **Problems in Your Code**
```python
dummy = cur = Node(-1, head)
while cur.next:
    print(f"cur={cur.next}, cur.next={cur.next.next}")
    next = cur.next.next
    cur.next = old_to_new[cur.next]
    cur.next.next = old_to_new[cur.next.next]
    cur.next.random = old_to_new[cur.next.random]
    cur = next
```
You're using the **two-pass approach**, where you first create a mapping of old nodes to new nodes and then set up the `next` and `random` pointers in a second pass. However, there are several issues in the code:

1. **`cur.next = old_to_new[cur.next]` modifies the linked list structure incorrectly.**  
   - The `cur.next` pointer should remain pointing to the original list nodes during iteration, but your modification makes it point to new nodes too early.
   - This breaks the traversal of the original list.

2. **Dereferencing `cur.next.next` and `cur.next.random` incorrectly.**  
   - `cur.next` is modified in-place before accessing `cur.next.next`, so `cur.next.next` no longer points to the original list correctly.
   - The same issue applies to `cur.next.random`.

3. **You're using `cur = next`, but `next` is set before modifying `cur.next`.**  
   - `next = cur.next.next` assumes `cur.next` still refers to the original node, but it has already been replaced.

---

### **Corrected Approach**
You should traverse the original list without modifying `cur.next` until you're done processing all nodes.

```python
class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not head:
            return None

        old_to_new = {}

        # First pass: Create new nodes and map old nodes to new ones
        cur = head
        while cur:
            old_to_new[cur] = Node(cur.val)
            cur = cur.next

        # Second pass: Assign next and random pointers
        cur = head
        while cur:
            if cur.next:
                old_to_new[cur].next = old_to_new[cur.next]
            if cur.random:
                old_to_new[cur].random = old_to_new[cur.random]
            cur = cur.next

        return old_to_new[head]  # Return the deep copied head
```

---

### **Fixes and Explanations**
1. **First pass:**
   - Create a **new node** for each node in the original list and store it in `old_to_new` **without modifying pointers**.

2. **Second pass:**
   - **Correctly assign `next` and `random` pointers** by using the `old_to_new` mapping.
   - Ensure `cur.next` and `cur.random` are always referring to the original list during traversal.

### **Key Takeaways**
- The original list should **not be modified** while copying nodes.
- Use a **hashmap** to keep track of mappings before modifying pointers.
- Carefully update `next` and `random` without breaking the traversal.

This should fix your issue and give the correct deep copy of the list. ðŸš€
## Why this works

Let's break down the behavior of these two lines:

```python
copy.next = old_to_new[cur.next]
cur = cur.next
```

This happens inside a **while loop**, where `cur` is traversing the original list and `old_to_new` is a dictionary mapping original nodes to their corresponding copied nodes.

---

## **How `copy.next = old_to_new[cur.next]` Works**
1. `cur` is pointing to the current node in the original list.
2. `cur.next` is the next node in the **original list**.
3. `old_to_new[cur]` gives us the **corresponding copied node**.
4. `old_to_new[cur.next]` gives us the **copied version of the next node in the original list**.
5. We set `copy.next` (the copied node's `next` pointer) to point to the copied version of `cur.next`.

### **Example**
Consider the original list:

```
Original List:  1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ None
```
And assume we already built the mapping:
```
old_to_new = {
    1: Node(1),
    2: Node(2),
    3: Node(3),
    None: None  # This ensures `old_to_new[cur.next]` works even at the last node.
}
```

Let's say `cur` is at **node 1** (`cur = 1`):
```python
copy = old_to_new[cur]       # copy = Node(1)
copy.next = old_to_new[cur.next]  # copy.next = old_to_new[2] => copy.next = Node(2)
```
Now, `copy.next` is set correctly.

---

## **How `cur = cur.next` Works**
After setting the `next` and `random` pointers for the current copied node, we move to the **next node in the original list**:

```python
cur = cur.next
```

This moves `cur` to `cur.next`, meaning:
- If `cur` was `1`, now `cur = 2`
- If `cur` was `2`, now `cur = 3`
- If `cur` was `3`, now `cur = None`, so the loop stops.

---

## **Step-by-Step Execution**
Let's say our original linked list is:
```
1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ None
```
And assume we already created the `old_to_new` dictionary.

**Iteration 1 (`cur = 1`)**
- `copy = old_to_new[1] â†’ Node(1)`
- `copy.next = old_to_new[2] â†’ Node(2)`
- Move `cur = 2`

**Iteration 2 (`cur = 2`)**
- `copy = old_to_new[2] â†’ Node(2)`
- `copy.next = old_to_new[3] â†’ Node(3)`
- Move `cur = 3`

**Iteration 3 (`cur = 3`)**
- `copy = old_to_new[3] â†’ Node(3)`
- `copy.next = old_to_new[None] â†’ None`
- Move `cur = None` (loop stops)

---

## **Key Takeaways**
âœ… `copy.next = old_to_new[cur.next]` correctly assigns the next pointer of the copied list using the mapping.  
âœ… `cur = cur.next` ensures that we traverse the **original list** while modifying the **copied list**.  
âœ… Since `old_to_new` ensures mapping, even when `cur.next` is `None`, `old_to_new[cur.next]` correctly resolves to `None`.

This approach ensures that the deep copy maintains the correct structure while iterating through the original list. ðŸš€


# (6) copy list random one pass
Let's break down the **hashmap one-pass approach** for copying a linked list with random pointers.  

---

## **Understanding the Problem**
Each node in the list has:
1. A `val` (value).
2. A `next` pointer (to the next node in the list).
3. A `random` pointer (which may point to any node in the list or be `None`).

We need to create a **deep copy** of the list, meaning:
- Each node in the copied list should be **entirely new**, not reference any nodes from the original list.
- The `next` and `random` pointers of the copied list should be correctly set.

---

## **Code Walkthrough**
```python
class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        oldToCopy = collections.defaultdict(lambda: Node(0))  # Step 1
        oldToCopy[None] = None  # Step 2
        
        cur = head
        while cur:  # Step 3
            oldToCopy[cur].val = cur.val  # Step 4
            oldToCopy[cur].next = oldToCopy[cur.next]  # Step 5
            oldToCopy[cur].random = oldToCopy[cur.random]  # Step 6
            cur = cur.next  # Step 7
        
        return oldToCopy[head]  # Step 8
```

---

## **Step-by-Step Explanation**
### **Step 1: Initialize a HashMap (`oldToCopy`)**
```python
oldToCopy = collections.defaultdict(lambda: Node(0))
```
- We use a `defaultdict` where each key is an original node and the value is a new node (`Node(0)`, a dummy node).
- This ensures that when we reference `oldToCopy[cur]` (for any `cur` in the original list), a new node is automatically created **if it doesn't exist yet**.

---

### **Step 2: Handle `None` Case**
```python
oldToCopy[None] = None
```
- This ensures that if `cur.next` or `cur.random` is `None`, `oldToCopy[None]` will return `None`, preventing errors.

---

### **Step 3: Traverse the Original List**
```python
cur = head
while cur:
```
- We iterate through the original list, processing each node.

---

### **Step 4: Copy Node Value**
```python
oldToCopy[cur].val = cur.val
```
- `oldToCopy[cur]` retrieves (or creates) the copied version of `cur`.
- We assign the same `val` from `cur` to `oldToCopy[cur]`.

---

### **Step 5: Copy `next` Pointer**
```python
oldToCopy[cur].next = oldToCopy[cur.next]
```
- `cur.next` is the next node in the **original list**.
- `oldToCopy[cur.next]` is the copied version of that next node.
- We set `oldToCopy[cur].next` to point to the copied version.

âœ… This ensures that `next` pointers are correctly mapped.

---

### **Step 6: Copy `random` Pointer**
```python
oldToCopy[cur].random = oldToCopy[cur.random]
```
- `cur.random` is the random pointer of the **original node**.
- `oldToCopy[cur.random]` retrieves (or creates) the copied version of the random node.
- We set `oldToCopy[cur].random` accordingly.

âœ… This ensures that `random` pointers are correctly mapped.

---

### **Step 7: Move to Next Node**
```python
cur = cur.next
```
- Moves `cur` to the next node in the **original list**, repeating the process.

---

### **Step 8: Return Copied Head**
```python
return oldToCopy[head]
```
- `oldToCopy[head]` returns the copied version of the original head.
- Since all `next` and `random` pointers were properly assigned, we now have a fully deep-copied list.

---

## **Example Walkthrough**
### **Original List**
```
1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ None
|    |    |
â†“    â†“    â†“
3    1    2
```
- Node `1` points to `2`, and its `random` points to `3`.
- Node `2` points to `3`, and its `random` points to `1`.
- Node `3` points to `None`, and its `random` points to `2`.

---

### **Execution Step-by-Step**
#### **Step 1: Create `oldToCopy` and handle `None`**
```python
oldToCopy = collections.defaultdict(lambda: Node(0))
oldToCopy[None] = None
```

#### **Step 2: First Iteration (`cur = 1`)**
```python
oldToCopy[1].val = 1
oldToCopy[1].next = oldToCopy[2]
oldToCopy[1].random = oldToCopy[3]
```
- `oldToCopy[1]` is created and set with `val = 1`.
- `next` pointer is assigned to `oldToCopy[2]`.
- `random` pointer is assigned to `oldToCopy[3]`.

#### **Step 3: Second Iteration (`cur = 2`)**
```python
oldToCopy[2].val = 2
oldToCopy[2].next = oldToCopy[3]
oldToCopy[2].random = oldToCopy[1]
```
- `oldToCopy[2]` is created and set with `val = 2`.
- `next` pointer is assigned to `oldToCopy[3]`.
- `random` pointer is assigned to `oldToCopy[1]`.

#### **Step 4: Third Iteration (`cur = 3`)**
```python
oldToCopy[3].val = 3
oldToCopy[3].next = oldToCopy[None]  # None
oldToCopy[3].random = oldToCopy[2]
```
- `oldToCopy[3]` is created and set with `val = 3`.
- `next` pointer is `None`.
- `random` pointer is assigned to `oldToCopy[2]`.

#### **Step 5: Return Copied Head**
```python
return oldToCopy[head]
```
Now, the copied list is:
```
1' â†’ 2' â†’ 3' â†’ None
|     |     |
â†“     â†“     â†“
3'    1'    2'
```
Where `1'`, `2'`, `3'` are deep copies.

---

## **Complexity Analysis**
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \), because we traverse the original list once.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \), for storing `oldToCopy` (a copy of every node).

---

## **Key Takeaways**
âœ… **One-pass solution** due to `defaultdict`.  
âœ… **Avoids extra iterations** by creating and linking nodes dynamically.  
âœ… **Guarantees correctness** since every node is mapped before use.  

This is a clever way to deep-copy a linked list efficiently! ðŸš€


# (7) Add two numbers

This line:  
```python
carry, val = divmod(v1 + v2 + carry, 10)
```
is a **compact way** of computing both the digit value and the carry for addition in **linked list problems**, such as adding two numbers represented as linked lists.

---

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
1. **Compute the sum**:  
   - `v1 + v2 + carry` adds:
     - `v1` (digit from the first linked list)
     - `v2` (digit from the second linked list)
     - `carry` (from the previous addition step)

2. **Use `divmod(x, y)` to get quotient and remainder**:  
   ```python
   carry, val = divmod(v1 + v2 + carry, 10)
   ```
   - `divmod(a, b)` returns **two values**:
     - **Quotient (`carry`)**: `a // b` (integer division)
     - **Remainder (`val`)**: `a % b` (modulus operation)

---

### **Example Walkthrough**
Letâ€™s consider an example where we add two numbers represented as linked lists:

#### **Example 1: Adding digits `7` and `8` with `carry = 0`**
```python
carry, val = divmod(7 + 8 + 0, 10)
```
- `7 + 8 + 0 = 15`
- `divmod(15, 10)` gives:
  - `carry = 1` (because `15 // 10 = 1`)
  - `val = 5` (because `15 % 10 = 5`)
---

### **Why is `divmod` useful here?**
- **Concise Code**: Instead of writing:
  ```python
  total = v1 + v2 + carry
  carry = total // 10
  val = total % 10
  ```
  We use `carry, val = divmod(total, 10)`, which does the same in one step.
- **Efficient**: Uses a built-in function optimized for division and modulus operations.

Would you like me to trace this in a real code snippet where we add two linked lists?



Mathematically, adding two numbers gives the same result regardless of whether you add them **from left to right** (front) or **from right to left** (back). This is because **addition is commutative and associative**:

1. **Commutative Property** â†’ The order of numbers doesn't matter:  
   \[
   a + b = b + a
   \]

2. **Associative Property** â†’ The way numbers are grouped doesn't matter:  
   \[
   (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
   \]

---

### **Why Order Doesn't Matter in Addition?**
Let's take an example:

**Number 1:** \(342\)  
**Number 2:** \(465\)  

If we add them **from left to right (normal addition):**  
\[
342 + 465 = 807
\]

If we add them **from right to left (column addition, like in the linked list problem):**  
- Add units place: \(2 + 5 = 7\)
- Add tens place: \(4 + 6 = 10\) (carry 1)
- Add hundreds place: \(3 + 4 + 1 = 8\)

The sum is still **807**.

**Key Insight:** The position of digits **determines their place value**, but whether we add from front or back, the **final sum remains the same** because each place contributes correctly due to carrying.

---

### **What Changes When Storing Numbers in Reverse Order?**
- Normally, numbers are written **left to right**: \( 342 = 3 \times 100 + 4 \times 10 + 2 \times 1 \).
- In linked lists (like in the problem), numbers are stored **right to left**:  
  **\([2,4,3]\) represents \(342\), not \(243\)**.
- However, **addition rules remain the same**, and carrying ensures that place values are handled properly.

# (8) find duplicate

The bit manipulation solution works by reconstructing the duplicate number **bit by bit**. Let's break it down step by step.

---

### **Intuition**
Each number in `nums` is in the range `[1, n-1]`. If there is a duplicate, it means some bits will appear **more times than expected** in the array.

We compare the **bit frequency** in the given array (`nums`) vs. the expected range `[1, n-1]`. If a bit appears **more often** in `nums`, it must be part of the duplicate.

---

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**
#### **1. Initialization**
```python
n = len(nums)  # Number of elements in nums (n + 1 elements)
res = 0        # This will store the duplicate number
```
- `n` is the length of `nums`, meaning numbers are in the range `[1, n-1]`.
- `res` will accumulate the bits of the duplicate number.

#### **2. Iterating Through Each Bit Position**
```python
for b in range(32):
```
- Since integers in Python can be large, we iterate through **32-bit positions**.
- This ensures we capture any number in a **reasonable range**.

#### **3. Counting the Number of `1`s for Each Bit**
```python
x = y = 0
mask = 1 << b  # Creating a bit mask for the b-th bit
```
- `mask = 1 << b` creates a bit mask that isolates the `b`-th bit.
  - Example: `1 << 2` (00000100 in binary) isolates the **3rd bit**.
- `x`: Count of `1`s in `nums` for the `b`-th bit.
- `y`: Expected count of `1`s in `[1, n-1]` for the `b`-th bit.

---

#### **4. Count How Many Times the `b`-th Bit is Set in `nums`**
```python
for num in nums:
    if num & mask:
        x += 1
```
- If `num & mask` is **non-zero**, it means the `b`-th bit in `num` is set.
- `x` counts how many numbers in `nums` have the `b`-th bit set.

Example:
```
nums = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]
Checking 2nd bit (mask = 00000100):
 - 1 (00000001) â†’ 0
 - 3 (00000011) â†’ 1
 - 4 (00000100) â†’ 1
 - 2 (00000010) â†’ 0
 - 2 (00000010) â†’ 0
Total x = 2
```

---

#### **5. Count How Many Times the `b`-th Bit is Set in `[1, n-1]`**
```python
for num in range(1, n):
    if num & mask:
        y += 1
```
- This counts how many times the `b`-th bit is set in **the expected range `[1, n-1]`**.

Example:
```
Expected range [1, 2, 3, 4]
Checking 2nd bit (mask = 00000100):
 - 1 (00000001) â†’ 0
 - 2 (00000010) â†’ 0
 - 3 (00000011) â†’ 1
 - 4 (00000100) â†’ 1
Total y = 2
```

---

#### **6. If `x > y`, the Bit Belongs to the Duplicate**
```python
if x > y:
    res |= mask
```
- If the count in `nums` (`x`) is greater than the expected count (`y`), it means the duplicate number contributes extra `1`s at this bit position.
- `res |= mask` **sets the corresponding bit** in the result.

Example:
```
If x = 3, y = 2, then:
 - x > y â†’ This bit belongs to the duplicate.
 - res |= mask â†’ This bit is added to `res`.
```

---

### **Final Output**
```python
return res
```
- After all 32 bits are processed, `res` contains the duplicate number.

---

## **Example Walkthrough**
### **Input:**
```python
nums = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]
```
### **Binary Representation of Numbers**
```
1  = 0001
2  = 0010
3  = 0011
4  = 0100
2  = 0010  (Duplicate)
```
### **Counting the Bits**
For each bit position (from 0 to 31):

| Bit Position | Count in `nums` (`x`) | Count in `[1, n-1]` (`y`) | Condition (`x > y`) | `res` after OR operation |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **0 (0001)** | `2` (`1, 3`) | `2` (`1, 3`) | No | 0000 |
| **1 (0010)** | `3` (`2, 2, 3`) | `2` (`2, 3`) | **Yes** | 0010 |
| **2 (0100)** | `1` (`4`) | `1` (`4`) | No | 0010 |
| **3+ (1000, 0000, etc.)** | `0` | `0` | No | 0010 |

### **Final `res` in Binary**
```
res = 0010 (which is 2)
```
### **Output:**
```python
2
```

---

## **Time and Space Complexity**
âœ… **Time Complexity**: \( O(n \log n) \)  
   - We iterate **32 times** (for each bit).
   - Each iteration scans `nums` (`O(n)`), making it **O(n log n)**.

âœ… **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \)  
   - We only use `res`, `x`, `y`, and `mask`, which are all **constant extra space**.

---

## **Why This Works?**
- Since numbers are limited to `[1, n-1]`, each bit must match the expected bit count in `[1, n-1]` **except for the duplicate**.
- By comparing **actual vs. expected bit counts**, we reconstruct the duplicate number bit-by-bit.

---

### **Summary**
- The solution iterates over **32 bits**, checking if the bit is overrepresented in `nums`.
- If a bit is **more frequent in `nums` than in `[1, n-1]`**, it **belongs to the duplicate**.
- We accumulate the bits in `res` using `res |= mask`.

This technique effectively finds the duplicate **without modifying `nums` and using only O(1) extra space**.

# (9) LRU cache
- **Learned about the OrderedDict DS and implemented similar functions**
