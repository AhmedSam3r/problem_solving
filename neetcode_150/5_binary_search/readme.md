## 1) Binary Search Problem
The condition `l - 1` in the return statement of the given code is key to understanding how this **upper bound binary search** works. Let me break it down step by step.

---

### **How the Algorithm Works**
1. **Initialization**:
   - `l` (left) is initialized to `0`.
   - `r` (right) is initialized to `len(nums)`.
   - The search space is `[l, r)` (inclusive of `l` but exclusive of `r`).

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - While `l < r`, the middle index `m` is calculated as `l + ((r - l) // 2)`.
   - The algorithm checks whether the element at `nums[m]` is greater than, less than, or equal to the `target`.
     - If `nums[m] > target`, it reduces the search space to `[l, m)`, effectively eliminating elements greater than the `target`.
     - If `nums[m] <= target`, it moves `l` to `m + 1`, because it is looking for the **last occurrence** of the `target` or the first element greater than `target`.

3. **Final `l` Value**:
   - When the loop ends, `l` points to the smallest index where `nums[l] > target` (if such an index exists) or the end of the array (`len(nums)`) if all elements are less than or equal to the `target`.

---

### **Why Use `l - 1`?**
After the loop:
- `l` points to the **first index greater than `target`**. To get the index of the **last occurrence** of the `target`, we need to check the element **just before `l`**, i.e., `l - 1`.

#### **Condition Explained**:
1. `if l and nums[l - 1] == target`:
   - `l` ensures that `l - 1` is a valid index (i.e., not `-1`).
   - `nums[l - 1] == target` confirms that the element just before `l` is the `target`.

2. **Return `l - 1`**:
   - If the condition is true, return `l - 1` because it is the index of the last occurrence of the `target`.

3. **Return `-1`**:
   - If the condition is false, it means the `target` does not exist in the array.

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 1:
```python
nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
target = 2
```

- **Step 1**: Initialize `l = 0, r = 5`.
- **Step 2**: Perform binary search:
  1. `m = 2`. `nums[m] = 2`, so `l = m + 1 = 3`.
  2. `m = 4`. `nums[m] = 4 > target`, so `r = m = 4`.
  3. `m = 3`. `nums[m] = 3 > target`, so `r = m = 3`.
- **Step 3**: Exit loop with `l = 3`. At this point:
  - `nums[l - 1] = nums[2] = 2` (last occurrence of `2`).
- **Return**: `l - 1 = 2`.

#### Example 2:
```python
nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
target = 5
```

- **Step 1**: Initialize `l = 0, r = 5`.
- **Step 2**: Perform binary search:
  1. `m = 2`. `nums[m] = 2`, so `l = m + 1 = 3`.
  2. `m = 4`. `nums[m] = 4`, so `l = m + 1 = 5`.
- **Step 3**: Exit loop with `l = 5`. At this point:
  - `nums[l - 1] = nums[4] = 4` (not the `target`).
- **Return**: `-1`.

#### Example 3:
```python
nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
target = 0
```

- **Step 1**: Initialize `l = 0, r = 5`.
- **Step 2**: Perform binary search:
  1. `m = 2`. `nums[m] = 2 > target`, so `r = m = 2`.
  2. `m = 1`. `nums[m] = 2 > target`, so `r = m = 1`.
  3. `m = 0`. `nums[m] = 1 > target`, so `r = m = 0`.
- **Step 3**: Exit loop with `l = 0`. At this point:
  - `l - 1 = -1` (invalid index).
- **Return**: `-1`.

### **Worst Case**
The worst-case time complexity is **O(log n)**:
- The search space is halved on every iteration of the loop, as it is typical for binary search.

The **key observation** is that the `l - 1` condition works because `l` is guaranteed to point to the smallest index greater than the `target` or the end of the array. By checking `nums[l - 1]`, you validate whether the `target` is present just before that point.


## 7 Median two sorted arrays

The line  
```python
half_length = (m + n + 1) // 2
```
is used to determine the number of elements that should be on the **left partition** of the merged array when dividing `nums1` and `nums2` for finding the median efficiently using **binary search**.

---

### **Why Do We Compute This?**
To find the **median**, we need to **partition** the two sorted arrays such that:

- The left partition contains the **smaller half** of the numbers.
- The right partition contains the **larger half** of the numbers.

Since the median is the **middle** value in a sorted list:
- If the total number of elements `(m + n)` is **odd**, the median is the middle element.
- If the total number of elements `(m + n)` is **even**, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

Thus, when we merge two sorted arrays, the **left partition** should contain `(m + n) // 2` elements if `(m + n)` is even.  
If `(m + n)` is odd, the left partition should contain one extra element, i.e., `(m + n) // 2 + 1`, so that the median is the maximum element in the left partition.

To combine both cases, we use:
```python
half_length = (m + n + 1) // 2
```
This ensures that:
1. If `(m + n)` is **even**, `half_length = (m + n) / 2`
2. If `(m + n)` is **odd**, `half_length = (m + n) / 2 + 1`

---

### **Example 1: Even Length**
#### **nums1 = [1, 3]**, **nums2 = [2, 4]**  
Merged array = `[1, 2, 3, 4]`  
Total elements = `4` (even)  
Thus, `half_length = (4 + 1) // 2 = 2`

This means that after partitioning, the **first two elements** should be in the left partition:  
`[1, 2]` â†’ left partition  
`[3, 4]` â†’ right partition  

Median = `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`

---

### **Example 2: Odd Length**
#### **nums1 = [1, 2]**, **nums2 = [3]**  
Merged array = `[1, 2, 3]`  
Total elements = `3` (odd)  
Thus, `half_length = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2`

This means that after partitioning, the **first two elements** should be in the left partition:  
`[1, 2]` â†’ left partition  
`[3]` â†’ right partition  

Median = `2.0` (largest element in the left partition)

---

### **Key Takeaways**
1. We need `half_length` elements in the **left partition** to ensure correct median calculation.
2. We add `1` to `(m + n)` before integer division to handle both **odd and even cases** properly.
3. The **left partition** always contains one extra element when `(m + n)` is odd, ensuring that the median is directly accessible.
